We Love Us
Tommy Smothers

You love me for loving you,
And you are you because I do.
I love you for loving me,
And I am me because of you.

So much in love with us are we.
So much in love with us are we.

You kiss me for kissing you,
And you are you because I do.
And I kiss you for kissing me,
And I am me because of you.

So much in love with us are we,
You could kiss you and I could kiss me.
